# Node System

This project is a base of the node system.

As the node system improves, it will contain components for creating interfaces. You will not need to know a programming language to build your own interface or create some program based on Flet

But at the moment there is nothing. Only the basic node system, movement around the viewport.


## Issue: Zooming from the Center

Zoom occurs from the center of the container. Not from the center of the screen or mouse. If you understand math well enough, please help improve this feature.

## How to Set Up

Download the archive and run `main.py`
